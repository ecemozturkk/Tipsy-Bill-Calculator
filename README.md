# Tipsy ðŸ’¸

Tipsy is a simple and intuitive app that helps users quickly and easily calculate the total cost of their bill, including a tip, based on the number of people splitting the bill. With a user-friendly interface, Tipsy makes it easy to input the total bill amount and select the desired tip percentage. The app then calculates the total cost of the bill, including the tip, and displays it for the user.
